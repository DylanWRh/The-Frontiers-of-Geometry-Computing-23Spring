# Assignment 3

## TODO

- Read data from the [XYZ file](./gargoyle.xyz), including points and their normals.
- Implement MLP to do reconstruction.
- Save the results.
- Write a report.

## Requirements

- Except for the algorithm, I/O operation should also be implemented by yourself.
- Mind your code style.

## Hint

- OBJ/OFF/PLY file can be visualized with **meshlab** or [**meshviewer**](../MeshViewer) attached.
- PyTorch is recommanded for your implementation.
