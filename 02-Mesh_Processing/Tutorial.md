# Assignment 2

## TODO

- Read data from OBJ files in [data](./data).
- Implement **ANY ONE** of the following algorithms: deformation, parameterization, simplification and smoothing.
- Save the results.
- Write a report.

## Requirements

- Except for the algorithm, I/O operation should also be implemented by yourself.
- Programming language can be Python/C++.
- Mind your code style.

## Hint

- OBJ/OFF/PLY file can be visualized with **meshlab** or [**meshviewer**](../MeshViewer) attached.
- If you want to use the HalfEdge data structure, you are free to use OpenMesh([C++](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/), [Python](https://pypi.org/project/openmesh/)).
- **ONE OF** the topics for your term project is to design an interactive UI for mesh deformation.
